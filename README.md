## **Steps Followed**

### 1. **Data Collection**
- Gathered the food delivery dataset from the provided data source.

### 2. **Data Preprocessing**
- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Handled missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Extracted relevant features for the prediction model.

### 3. **Model Development**
- Used regression algorithms to train the food delivery time prediction model.
- Explored multiple algorithms to identify the best-performing one:
  - **Linear Regression**
  - **Decision Trees**
  - **Random Forests**
  - **XGBoost**

### 4. **Model Evaluation**
- Evaluated model performance using the following metrics:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - R-squared (R²) score
- The **XGBoost model** achieved the highest performance with an R² score of **0.82**.

### 5. **Deployment**
- Deployed the prediction model as a standalone application using **Streamlit** for real-time predictions.

## **Results and Evaluation Criteria**
The **XGBoost model** emerged as the best-performing algorithm based on evaluation metrics. It achieved:
- **R-squared (R²):** 0.82
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** _(Add value if available)_
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** _(Add value if available)_

These results demonstrate the model's ability to provide reasonably accurate delivery time predictions.
